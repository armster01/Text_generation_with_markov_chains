# Text_generation_with_markov_chains_PRODIGY_GA_03
## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Markov chains for text generation using the Markovify library. By training on a dataset of airport reviews, the model generates coherent and contextually relevant text. This project is an exploration into natural language processing (NLP) techniques, focusing on the application of Markov models for creative text generation.
## Features
Markov Chain Implementation: Utilizes the Markovify library to build a Markov chain model for text generation.
<br>
Airport Reviews Dataset: Trains the model on a dataset of airport reviews, enabling it to generate text that mimics the style and content of the reviews.
<br>
Customizable Parameters: Allows for adjustments in the Markov chain parameters to control the coherence and randomness of the generated text.
